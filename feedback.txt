You might also benefit from looking at her work on the exponential decay of scattering coefficients:

Lack of conclusion
Clarify “separable scattering” in the papers of Sifre and Mallat, Andén and Mallat, circa 2012-2015. Adopting Mallat’s language, the current paper proposes a *joint* n-D scattering with *separable* filters. Actual separable scattering would have a modulus nonlinearity after each 1-D wavelet transform. I am OK with the current title of the paper but it would be good to cite one of these “old-time” papers and state the distinction, to clear up any possible confusion.

"It is likely that better results can be achieved by the proposed method if the filters are made learnable and/or scattering parameters and network architectures are uniquely optimised for each dataset"
